//Just need to use "use client" in any component which we want to use and the data of that will be available in client-side

our default pages are "server side" only so in those oages we cant't use "useState",useEffect" ,"hooks" directly we have to make our page cliebt fisrt.

to any component we cant deffrentiate them by giving them "use client" or not, which means we can use client side data on server side page also

If you want to hide your code or read any code then you can also use "fs module" in server side by :->

let a = fs.readFile(".gitignore")
a.then(e=>{console.log(e.toString())})

you cant't resolve "fs-promises" on "use client"
